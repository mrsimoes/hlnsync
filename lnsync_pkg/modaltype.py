"""
A framework for building parallel class inheritance structures.

Goal
====
Suppose the behaviour of a class and its derived classes is to systematically
depend on an "mode" parameter, constant throughout the existence of each class
instance.

One approach is to have each method contain code to handle the various modes.

Alternatively, for a single class situation one could define a class A with the
common behaviour and subclasses Amode1, Amode2, etc for the each mode.

If B is derived from A and again its behaviour should declense on the mode
parameter, we want to define B, Bmode1, Bmode2, etc with the inheritance
relations Bmode1 -> B -> Amode1 -> A and likewise for each mode.

This is what this framework provides: declare A->B and defined the mode-specific
subclasses and have the inheritance structures for each mode automatically
built.

When creating an instance, x=A(mode=mode1) sets the mode value, and the correct
subclass Amode1 is selected.

Usage
=====
A metaclass modaltype is provided. Then define
    class A(metaclass=modaltype):
        <body of A>
    # and
    class A_modal(A, mode=modename): # The name is unimportant.
        <body of A_modename>

The common class A is called a "mode None" class, while the second is a
declensed class. These are all modal classes.

To create a declensed class, the mode None class must be explicitly created.

To create a modal class derived from another modal class:
    class B(A):
        <body of B>
And the declensed classes:
    class Bmode1(B, mode=mode1name):
        <body of B_mode1>
    class Bmode2(B, mode=mode2name):
        <body of B_mode2>

To create a modal class derived from a non-modal class:
    class B(A, metaclass=modaltype):
        <body of B>
And the declensions are created as before.

Noe each modal class, a mode attribute is set to the correct value, so
that it is available to instances even before __init__.

Implementation
==============
A metaclass modaltype manages the modal class menagerie and creates the modal
classes from the mode None class.

modaltype.__new__ is invoked when the class statement is evaluated:
    class mymodalcls(metaclass=modaltype):
        <body>
    class mymodalcls(mode=mode1):
        <body>

modaltype.__call__ is invoked when modal class instances are created e.g.
    x = mymodalcls(args, ..., mode=mode1)

The following informatin is kept:

If a mode None class A is declared as derived from B and Amode1 is a declension
of A, then
- If B is a modal class, then
    - A.__bases__ == (modalobject,)
    - A._modal_super == B
    - Amode1.__bases__ == (A, Bmode1) # A dummy Bmode1 is created, if needed.
    - Amode1._modal_super == B
- If B is a non-modal class, then
    - A.__bases__ == (modalobject, B)
    - A._modal_super == None
    - Amode1.__bases__ == (A,)
    - Amode1._modal_super == None

Each mode None class has an attribute
    - _modal_declensions, a dict from mode string to the corresponding
    declensed modal class.


Limitations
===========
Each modal class is allowed only one base class.
- No multiple inheritance for modal classes. (It would only require a
reimplementation of the C3 MRO.)
- The same class name cannot be reused across different scopes, as they are
registered globally at modaltype.
